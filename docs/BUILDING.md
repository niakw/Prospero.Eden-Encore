# Building ProsperoEden

ProsperoEden builds on Linux (Ubuntu 26.04; WSL works). One command builds the release:

```bash
make
```

The first run fetches every dependency at its pinned revision, builds the RADV driver and
Eden for the PS5, and writes the release files to `dist/`:

- `ProsperoEden-vX.Y.Z.zip`: the `PPSA99008` folder to copy to `/data/homebrew/PPSA99008`;
- `ProsperoEden-vX.Y.Z.ffpfsc`: the same folder as a compressed PFS image that
  ShadowMountPlus installs like a package;
- `SHA256SUMS` and `release-notes.md`.

The first build takes a while (RADV and Eden are large). Later builds reuse everything that
already exists: the dependencies, this checkout's build cache in
`~/.cache/ps5-eden-headless.<hash>`, and ccache.

## Make targets

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make` / `make release` | Release files in `dist/` |
| `make package` | Only the app folder, `build/release/PPSA99008` |
| `make image` | Only the `.ffpfsc` package image |
| `make install PS5_HOST=<address>` | Copy `build/release/PPSA99008` to a console over FTP (close ProsperoEden first) |
| `make dev DEV_TITLE=<title ID>` | Development build, `build/dev/PPSA99008` (or `EDEN_DEV_PACKAGE_DIR`): profiling counters, `dev-settings.txt` switches, boots the given title |
| `make test` | Host (Linux) build of the emulator and its test suites |
| `make deps` | Fetch missing dependencies at their pinned revisions |
| `make deps-status` | List the dependencies, where they live and whether they match their pins |
| `make prepare` | Everything besides Eden itself: build cache, FFmpeg, packaging tool, driver stub, RADV |
| `make toolchain` | Check the host tools |
| `make clean` | Remove `build/` and `dist/` |
| `make distclean` | Also remove the fetched `.deps` and this checkout's build cache |

`JOBS=<n>` sets the number of parallel compile jobs (default: all cores).

## Dependencies

Every input is pinned in `tools/deps.json` and fetched by `make deps` (`tools/deps.py`) only when
it is missing: archives are checked against their SHA-256/SHA-512 before use and git
repositories are fetched at their pinned commit. Nothing that already exists is modified, so a
checkout you work in stays at whatever revision it has (`make deps-status` shows it).
Downloads are cached in `~/.cache/prosperoeden-deps` (`PROSPEROEDEN_DEPS_CACHE`).

Inside this repository, in `.deps/`:

- **Eden** at commit `5f142c7926d0c7fcbbd0ce30794d72f638a43b2a` (GitHub mirror archive), with
  Eden's own hash-pinned packages, which its configure step downloads. ProsperoEden does not
  modify Eden's files: the PS5 frontend in `headless/` replaces and derives sources at
  configure time (`headless/inject.cmake`).
- **FFmpeg** at the commit Eden pins, built with only the decoders games use.
- **PS5 OpenGL 4.6 SDK 1.0.0** (release archive), for the launcher and the OpenGL renderer.
- **OpenSSL and zlib** from pacbrew v0.40.2.
- **LLVM 18.1.8 compiler-rt** emulated-TLS sources and **fmt 12.1.0** headers.

Next to this repository (`../`), as git checkouts:

- **ps5-native-app-boilerplate**: the PS5 Payload SDK v0.42, the runtime `libc.prx` and the
  native packaging tool;
- **Mihawk's PS5_Vulkan, PS5_Mesa and PS5_PayloadSDK** (`../mihawk-*-review`): RADV and its
  build recipe. `make prepare` builds RADV once and isolates it beside the OpenGL Mesa
  (`tools/isolate-radv.py`). RADV's display code carries this repository's adaptation
  (`tools/patch-radv-wsi.py`: the output's lifetime, and the 120 Hz output a game session can ask
  for); when the adaptation changes, `make prepare` builds RADV again, which compiles only that
  file. The three checkouts have to be at the commits `tools/build-radv-dependencies.sh` names.

The `libSceAgcDriver` import facade both drivers link against is built from
`tools/stubs/libSceAgcDriver.c`. Small contracts from our research repositories are in
`third_party/`.

## Launcher

The launcher (`headless/prosperoeden`) draws with OpenGL through the PS5 OpenGL SDK and plays its
sounds through the console's audio output; it needs no other library. Its font atlas, artwork
and sounds are committed in `headless/prosperoeden/ui`, so a build does not regenerate them.
The tools that made them are in `tools/launcher`:

- `assets.sh` bakes the font (`third_party/fonts/Montserrat-Medium.ttf`) and renders the art from
  `assets/`; it needs a host C++ compiler and Python with Pillow.
- `process-sfx.py` trims and levels the raw sound effects (needs `ffmpeg` and `numpy`).
- `bake-wordmark.py` writes the "LOADING" lettering of the loading screen
  (`headless/loading_wordmark.glsl`).
- `preview.sh` draws every launcher screen on a PC (Mesa's software renderer, sample games) to
  PNG files or a video, with the same code, shaders and font as on the console.
- `strings.py` keeps the translations: `extract` writes the template (`launcher.pot`) from the
  text in the code, `new <tag>` starts a catalog in `headless/prosperoeden/ui/lang`, and `check`
  fails on missing or stale text, changed placeholders and characters the font does not have.
- `text-check.sh` compares the launcher's right-to-left text code with ICU on generated lines
  and on every translation (needs `libicu-dev`).

## Host tools

`make toolchain` checks them: `clang-18`, `lld-18` and the LLVM 18 tools, `cmake`, `ninja`,
`ccache`, `make`, `nasm`, `meson`, `rsync`, `git`, `glslangValidator`, `spirv-val`, `bison`,
- `librsvg2-bin` (`rsvg-convert`) for the official Eden PS5 icon
`flex`, `curl`, `wget`, `unzip`, and Python 3.11 or later with `venv`, `mako` and `yaml`.
The image step fetches [PSBrew/MkPFS](https://github.com/PSBrew/MkPFS) at a pinned commit into
`~/.cache/prosperoeden-mkpfs`.

## Crash reports

When the app crashes it writes `crash-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt` to its logs folder
(`/data/prosperoeden/logs`), starts again and says on the home screen where the report is
(`headless/crash_report.h`). At the next start that run's logs are moved beside the report
(`-stderr.log`, `-heap.log`, `-eden_log.txt`); the five newest reports are kept.

The report lists addresses as `eboot+0x...`. To get function names, files and lines:

```bash
python3 tools/symbolize-crash.py crash-20261001-121314.txt build/symbols/ProsperoEden-v1.000.040.elf
```

The second argument is the unstripped executable of the build that wrote the report:
`build/headless-native/llvm-pie.elf` right after a build. `make release` copies it to
`build/symbols/ProsperoEden-vX.Y.Z.elf`; keep that file with the release, it is not published.

`make test` checks the report on the host (`tools/check-crash-report.py`). A development build
crashes on request, to try it on a console: write `segv`, `thread`, `abort` or `throw` to
`crash-app.txt` in the app folder.

## Release workflow

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs `tools/ci/build-release.sh` (`make release`) on a
self-hosted runner labelled `prosperoeden`. `EDEN_DEV_CHECKOUT` in the runner's `.env` may name a
development checkout whose dependencies are reused instead of fetched.

- **Manual run** (Actions > Release build > Run workflow): builds the release files and keeps
  them as a 7-day artifact.
- **Tag `vX.Y.Z`**: builds them, checks that the tag matches the package version, and publishes
  a pre-release. The release notes come from the README's "Changes in vX.Y.Z" section.

To cut a release:

1. Bump the version in `headless/prosperoeden/version.h` (the launcher and the package read it).
2. Add the "Changes in" section to the README.
3. Test the build on a console.
4. Push a `vX.Y.Z` tag.
5. Keep `build/symbols/ProsperoEden-vX.Y.Z.elf` from the build that was published (crash reports
   are read with it).
