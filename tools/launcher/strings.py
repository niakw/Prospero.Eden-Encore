"""strings.py extract          write tools/launcher/launcher.pot from the text marked in the code
strings.py new <tag>          start headless/prosperoeden/ui/lang/<tag>.po from the template
strings.py check              check every catalog in headless/prosperoeden/ui/lang and embedded French
strings.py embed-fr           rebuild headless/prosperoeden/fr_fr_embedded.h from fr-FR.po

The code holds the English text: tr("...") where it is drawn, TR("...") in constant tables (and
the setting labels of headless/settings_store.h). A catalog is a gettext .po file named after the
PS5 system language's tag (third_party/ps5_system_language.hpp): pt-BR.po, fr-FR.po...

check keeps fr-FR complete because it is the release's primary maintained translation. Other
catalogs may be partial: missing text falls back to English at runtime and stale entries are
harmless. Every translation that is present is still validated.

check fails when
  - fr-FR leaves current code text untranslated,
  - a translation changes the {0} {1} placeholders,
  - a translation uses a character the launcher's font does not have.
It warns about partial/stale non-primary catalogs and translations much longer than English.

The launcher's own font has Latin and Cyrillic letters. Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Greek, Thai and
Arabic are drawn with the console's fonts (pe/gfx/system_fonts.hpp): their catalogs are checked
against those when PE_SYSTEM_FONTS names a folder holding copies of them, and only for their
Latin text otherwise.
