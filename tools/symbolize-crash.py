"""Names the functions in a ProsperoEden crash report (headless/crash_report.h).

  symbolize-crash.py REPORT ELF

REPORT is logs/crash-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt from a console. ELF is the unstripped executable of the
build that wrote it: build/headless-native/llvm-pie.elf right after a build, and for a release
the copy `make release` keeps (build/symbols/Prospero.Eden-Encore-R1.elf). Every "eboot+0x..." in the
report is an offset into that file's code; the report is printed again with the function, file
and line after each one.

The addresses under "calls found on the stack" are where calls return to, so the function named
is the caller. The list comes from scanning the stack: the console cannot read its own code, so
it lists every value that points into the code with a "?". Those are checked here against the
ELF, and the ones that do not follow a call instruction are left out. A function that returned
earlier can still show up in the list.
